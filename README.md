# Simulation of Spring 1 Object With Arrangement Without Horizontal Silencer
The simulation case that will be discussed is the case of a spring with 1 object without a damper with the solution using programming to find out the graph of the object's motion.

Case: A force of 3 N stretches a spring 1 m long. the spring constant (k) is 3 and the mass of the 4 kg object is related to the spring. At t=0 s, the mass is pushed 1 m from the equilibrium point and released with a speed of 0.5 m/s. Assuming there is no attenuation.
